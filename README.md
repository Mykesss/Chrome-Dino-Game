# About
Wrote this for university project in my first year.

Only copy that was on my PC got deleted when my HDD failed 
>No online backups..GENIUS

Luckily after 3 years found an USB drive that I used during that time which happened<br /> to contain a text file with C code. Using that I managed to recreate the whole thing again :)
